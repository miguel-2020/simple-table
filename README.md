# A Simple Table search using JavaScript

A brief description of what this project does:
You can print the entire column of the table to the screen by clicking the log selected column button.
Once clicked, it asks the user to enter a number from 1 to 4, which correlates to each of the columns in the table.
The "Find most expensive room button" is responsible for searching and displaying the most expensive room on the table.
